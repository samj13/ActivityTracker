The data is recorded like so (1-9):

Accel X, Accel Y, Accel Z, Gyro X, Gyro Y, Gyro Z, Mag X, Mag Y, Mag Z

Then 5 different time domain functions are run over all of the same labels in a window to make an attribute.

So attribute 1 is the mean(Accel X), 2 is std(Accel X), 3 is sum(abs(Accel X)), 4 is sum(Accel X^2),
5 is max(Accel X), 6 is mean(Accel Y), 7 is std(Acccel Y).....

Common ones:

45 - max(Mag Z)
20 - max(Gyro X)
43 - sum(abs(Mag Z))
8 - sum(abs(Accel Y))
7 - std(Accel Y)
42 - std(Mag Z)
26 - mean(Gyro Z)
11 - mean(Accel Z)
